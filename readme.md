# Customisation

Some variables are exposed in 'OJD-NINTENTDO-GAMEBOY/variables.ccs' for quick modification. After modifiying you have to select 'reload'
in open-joystick-display to see the changes.

## Streamer

All colours should be editable through the variables.css.

## Shell

Currently only the colour buttons turn when pressed can be changed from the variables.css. Further modification can be done by editing the
.svg files directly.
